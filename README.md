This code represents a Singleton pattern in the Go programming language. It demonstrates the Singleton pattern, which ensures that a class has only 
one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

Key parts of the code:

1)SingletonCounter is a structure representing a counter. It has a single field count, which represents the current count value.

2)var instance *SingletonCounter is a variable that will store the single instance of SingletonCounter.

3)GetInstance is a function that creates and returns an instance of SingletonCounter. If an instance already exists (instance != nil), it returns the existing instance. Otherwise, it creates a new instance.

4)Increment is a method of SingletonCounter that increments the count by 1.

5)GetCount is a method of SingletonCounter that returns the current count value.

In the main function, I create two instances of SingletonCounter, counter1 and counter2, using the GetInstance function. Then, I increment the counter
values and print the results. It's important to note that counter1 and counter2 both reference the same instance of SingletonCounter.

Therefore, this code is called a Singleton because it ensures there is only one instance of SingletonCounter, and we can access it globally from any part
of the program. This pattern provides centralized access to resources or data that should be shared across the entire application.
